
Determine the proper order to cut the lines of a shape/part


Order parts based on a way that makes sense
This will be very difficult as shapes become more complex. Obviously left to right is fairly simple,
however a zipper style is most efficient to cut and while in my head this seems simple the fact that
igems struggles oftentimes makes me think its not quite that simple.

perhaps order left to right first and then apply a zipper style afterwards?


Add vars that change based on machin like decimal precision changing between torch and wj etc
